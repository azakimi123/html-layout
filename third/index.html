            Singing songs of the truth, singing songs of the peaceful warrior nation
            Singing songs to the Gods, of Love and thankfulness
            'Cause we are alive and we're striving to thrive and we know that we're blessed
            
            'Cause we are the ones who come to wipe away the poison that's been seeping into the heart, that's keeping us apart
            Get down to the heart of the matter, all you're gonna find out is that all that matters is the heart, and at the end of the day
            Love will find a way" - Mike Love</p>
